control signals available in RT
zipfit profile avail in RT? but no owner, need to talk to d3d dave to see if we can take control of it
profile predction in PCS using mfit - needs tuning, right now just generic fitting alg
we can use real time efit?
we should own main pcs fit alg?
egemen and eldon using egemens fit alg for ray tracing and pedestal control

Te from thompson
Ti from CER but needs fitting/filtering - CERREAL
fast ion - rabbit


real time friendly
cant make system calls
no malloc
no multithread
send fdeep to keith 
need buffer of last ~10 profiles
eigen not real time friendly


can control beam power and voltage, all independent

pre shot hook for malloc and setup
real time function that predicts
post shot cleanup

user interface
look at yichens stuff from last year
our alg will live in same place
talk to ricardo about real time profiles, where they come from, how they're read, mfit, CER, thompson etc
anthony about CER
